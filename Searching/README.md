# Linear Search

Linear Search is a simple searching algorithm that checks each element in the list one by one until the target element is found or the list ends.

### Steps
1. Start from the first element.
2. Compare with the target.
3. If found, return the index.
4. If not found, return -1.

### Time Complexity
- Best Case: O(1)
- Worst Case: O(n)
- Average Case: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(1)

### Example
Array: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]  
Target: 30  
Output: Element found at index 2
